# Optimizing Mincraft

A collection of tools, scripts, plugins, and resources aimed at optimizing Minecraft's performance. We are focused on addressing common performance bottlenecks, reducing lag, improving frame rates, optimizing server performance, and enhancing overall gameplay.

## Getting Started

### Mod Loaders: Understanding Forge and Fabric

Before diving into the world of Minecraft optimization, it's essential to grasp the concept of mod loaders. Mod loaders are tools that allow you to add mods and modifications to Minecraft, expanding its features and functionality. The two most popular mod loaders for Minecraft are **Forge** and **Fabric**, each with its own unique characteristics.

#### Forge

Forge has been the dominant mod loader in the Minecraft community for a long time. It provides extensive modding capabilities and is compatible with a vast number of mods. Forge has a large and established modding community, making it an excellent choice if you're looking for a wide range of mod options. It offers a robust framework that allows developers to create complex and feature-rich mods for Minecraft.

#### Fabric

Fabric is a relatively newer mod loader compared to Forge. It focuses on providing a lightweight and efficient modding platform. Fabric's design emphasizes performance and compatibility with other optimization-focused mods and tools. It is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and speed. Fabric also has an active and growing modding community, making it a popular choice for those seeking a streamlined and optimized Minecraft experience.

#### Differences between Forge and Fabric

1. **Performance:** Fabric is generally considered to be more lightweight and optimized compared to Forge. It aims to provide a smoother gameplay experience by focusing on performance improvements and optimizations.

2. **Mod Availability:** Forge has a vast library of mods due to its long-standing presence in the Minecraft modding community. It offers a broader selection of mods, including more complex and feature-rich options. Fabric's mod library is growing rapidly, with a focus on lightweight and performance-oriented mods.

3. **Development Approach:** Forge and Fabric have different philosophies when it comes to mod development. Forge provides a more extensive and structured framework, allowing for complex mods and extensive modifications. Fabric, on the other hand, emphasizes a more modular and lightweight approach, making it easier to create and maintain smaller, performance-focused mods.

Choosing between Forge and Fabric ultimately depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you're looking for a wide variety of mods and a mature modding community, Forge may be the way to go. However, if you prioritize performance and optimization, Fabric might be a better fit.

In this repository, we aim to provide optimizations that can be applied to both Forge and Fabric setups. We will highlight any specific considerations or differences where applicable. Whether you choose Forge or Fabric, you'll find valuable optimization techniques and resources to enhance your Minecraft experience.
